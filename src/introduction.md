# Introduction

The reading group at USTC ADSL provides an opportunity for students, researchers, and faculty to keep abreast of current research in the system area and learn “how to do high-quality system research” by example.

<!-- Check out [the onging one](./2024_fall.md). -->

## Topic

The routine topic is a paper from recent top-tier system conference such as OSDI, SOSP, ASPLOS, SIGMOD, VLDB, ATC, EuroSys, NSDI, FAST etc.

## Presentation

The presentation should be structured around key discussion points. When guiding the discussion, the goal should be to guide the rest of the group through the discussion points above (roughly in order). And the slides may not exceed 40 pages.

## Content

The primary focus of the discussion is to understand what the paper says. With that in mind, we should focus on clearly identifying

- what is the problem being solved?
- what are the challenges? what makes the problem difficult?
- what are the key insights/techniques/lessons used to address those challenges? (i.e., how does it work)

We may discuss other points, but we should try to keep these points as secondary concerns as much as possible

- does it work? (i.e., evaluate the evaluation)
- why does the problem matter? i.e., why should we (not) read the paper?
- other points that arise
