# 2025 Fall

## Specific Requirements

- We focus on the latest papers from SOSP and OSDI, as well as papers released on arXiv. Each time presenters select one paper from SOSP or OSDI and one from arXiv.
- The presentation follows a "1+N" format, where one person delivers the main content while supporting members assist with preparation and manage the Q&A session. These supporting members are also encouraged to contribute to the presentation.
- The discussion should provide a thorough analysis of the paper’s strengths and weaknesses, along with a comprehensive review of related work from the past three years. The presentation must be at least 45 minutes long.
